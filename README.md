# Pokemon Index – Code Challenge

Built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, powered by the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)

## Features

- Responsive layout for mobile and desktop
- Paginated Pokemon cards with live data
- Cards per page selector (10, 20, 50)
- Sticky footer with mobile popup settings
- Error handling for slow/unavailable API
- Testable code structure

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the repo
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Choose how many cards to display per page
4. Navigate using **Next** and **Previous** buttons

## Live Demo

## Development

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pokemon-index.git

# Open the project folder and launch index.html

## Known Note
On desktop Chrome, mobile-style dropdowns (like the "cards per page" popup) might not behave exactly as expected due to browser limitations in emulating touch UIs.

For best results, test on a real mobile device.
